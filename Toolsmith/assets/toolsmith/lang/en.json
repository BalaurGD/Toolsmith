	"game:craftinginfo-toolsmithingbasics-title": "Toolsmithing - The Basics",
	"game:craftinginfo-toolsmithingbasics-text": "<strong>Toolsmithing</strong><br><i>Let me show you how to take care of that hatchet.</i><br>The first things you will notice are that some of your tools have multiple parts, as well as a second sharpness bar above the durability. Any tool that has three or more parts is a 'Tinkered Tool', while others that might be crafted in the grid or smithed and come out as one full tool are 'Smithed Tools'. That is the important distinction, Tinkered Tools can be customized and the parts chosen and crafted to increase that tool's durability and more, while a Smithed Tool is more singular, but both are capable of being maintained and repaired. A lot of information can also be found in various tooltips, so read those as well if you are confused!<br><br><strong>Crafting Methods</strong><br>As mentioned before, there are a lot of ways to customize your tools now, along with how you choose to craft them now as well. The old reliable option of the grid crafting is still viable, with expanded options for your handles and (optional) bindings. Just place a handle under the tool head and any binding to the right of it to put it together.<br>A second option is In-Hand crafting for Tinkered Tools! To start this, grab your tool head of choice and hold it in your main hand and stick your chosen handle in your offhand. Hold rightclick for a while to bundle them together as a single part - then follow suit with this pair in your main hand and an optional binding in the offhand to finish it! The binding is not required though, you can leave the offhand empty if you so choose. Happy tinkering!<br><br><strong>Sharpness and Wear</strong><br>Finally, that second bar - the Sharpness bar - is now found on any tool that does not have a blunt edge and needs to be sharp to be able to function. It's important to not let it run out, or your tools will take more damage - and a Drawback (not implemented yet!) is guaranteed to show up. To manage your tool's sharpness, it simply requires either a Knapped Whetstone, made out of any of the knappable stones, or a Grindstone.<br>A Grindstone can be crafted once you have access to boards and a proper piece of rock - abrasive stones like Sandstone and Granite work great for this, but also it is possible to get by with shale or andesite as well. Otherwise, a Whetstone is great for on-the-go sharpening; while the Grindstone being bulky, is best left at home in your workshop!",

	"game:craftinginfo-toolsmithcraftingmethods-title": "Toolsmithing - Crafting and Deconstruction Methods",
	"game:craftinginfo-toolsmithcraftingmethods-text": "<strong>In-Hand Crafting</strong><br>The primary method to craft your Tinkered Tools is to use the In-Hand crafting method. Just like the crafting grid, it can be accessed anywhere, since all you need are both hands freed. First, grab the parts you wish to use, for a regular Tool that will be a tool head, handle and optionally a binding. The binding is not required, but it will reinforce your tool's binding durability as well as provide some further benefits to your handle if it is of higher quality.<br>To actually use the in-hand crafting, take your tool head in the main hand, and put your handle of choice in the offhand. Check the tooltips to see what makes a valid handle and binding! Hold rightclick for a short while and you will pair that head with that handle for the first step of the crafting process. Then if you wish yto use a binding, stick that in your offhand now and rightclick with the too pair in the main hand once more, and after another short while, you will have constructed your tool!<br><br><strong>Grid Crafting</strong><br>Another option for putting together a tool is the classic option, just using the crafting grid. If you put your tool head of choice above any handle, and a binding to the right slot of the head, you can optionally use this method to craft your tools instead. It is otherwise the same as In-Hand crafting! These recipes are generated when the game loads, so they will generate more based on the configs on the server.<br><br><strong>Deconstruction</strong><br>You are also able to take a Tinkered Tool apart in the case you want to retrieve either the head or handle early! This requires either a Grindstone or a Workbench around, both of which require boards to craft, but this is generally needed only after you have gotten metal tool heads anyway. One important thing to note about Deconstructing your tool is that if you have used it at all, you will be unable to recover the binding from it since you will have to break it apart to not damage the handle or head any.<br>To deconstruct on a Grindstone, simply look at it with your tool in the main hand and hold shift while you rightclick on it. Hold this for a few seconds to take the tool apart! This is the same for the Workbench, except you simply have to look to the left of the bench at the Vise on it, and interact similarly with that.",
